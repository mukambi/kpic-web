## About KPIC

In collaboration with USAID, Data.FI developed a mobile and web-based application with a unique
identification approach for key populations (KPs) in Uganda―the key populations identifier code
(KPIC)―to facilitate their safe access to HIV services. The KPIC links client records across different
services provided by USAID by different implementing partners (IPs) in different parts of the country.
The KPIC does not contain any personally identifiable information and can be widely and securely
used without the need for device management and an expensive security infrastructure—and without
identifying KPs who could face legal problems and jail time if their identities were revealed.
The KPIC also supports KP groups who are transient or may access HIV services at multiple facilities
and supports systems to retain clients in care. For example, if somebody in Lira receives services and
then travels to Jinja, their linked case records are able to be accessed in either location by service
providers, who can then provide them with better services. This is made possible by the KPIC
generator.
